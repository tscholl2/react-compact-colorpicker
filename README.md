A very lightweight colorpicker. Just `ColorPicker = require "react-compact-colorpicker"` (for coffeescript) and `<ColorPicker onChange={(c) -> console.log c} />` to use! You can give it a color to start off with. See the `dev` branch for examples.

Was originally created as part of something for SageMathCloud.

Seems to work on mobile magically.
